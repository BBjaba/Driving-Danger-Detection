# Driving-Danger-Detection
This is an AI that can detect dangers while driving. Currently working on it. 
# Things it can detect
It's designed to detect alot dangers. But for now, I just implemented the `Drowsiness detection` and `Not looking to road detection`.
# How to use
Just run `main.py`. Then for testing, you can close your eyes or really get asleep (!). then change your face angle or move it to corners. But pay attention to 2 things:
  1. It may use alot CPU.
  2. Your camera should exactly be in front of you.
 
If you do these two things, the program should work perfectly (It worked for me in any angle and pose of face).
